 This is my university assignment for the "Artificial Intelligence" course. 
 It involved three phases: creating a puzzle game with 3x3 tiles and one empty square, then sorting the numbers by moving the square. 
In phase one, I sorted the numbers randomly without using any algorithm. 
In phase two, I applied the BFS algorithm and recorded the number of explored nodes. 
Finally, in phase three, the completed project incorporated the A* algorithm, along with the previous BFS implementation, an about page, and some UI enhancements, earning a perfect score.
